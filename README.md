# VGMTool 3

by Maxim, Apollolux, ValleyBell

The *legendary* VGM file processor, reborn as the phoenix! Where previous versions of VGMTool were Windows-only, this version shall be cross-platform thanks to the [phoenix](http://byuu.org) GUI toolkit wrapper.

# Compilation

Only the GUI is up; the actual processing code will be available next.
For now requires MinGW.
